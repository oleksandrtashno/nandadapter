1. Xgecu T48/T56 programmer with USB cable
2. Original adapter board (comes with Xgecu programmer)
  NOTE: Now Xgecu programmer comes with different boards that are not compatible with this design, and the one that I have is apparently hard to find now
3. This adapter board with pins and sockets soldered.

Parts 4, 5 and 6 come with 360-clip.
